The raw results file is saved in the `results` folder under `input/results_raw.csv`. These were obtained from the Maryland state Board of Elections Election Day [Precinct Results feed](https://elections.maryland.gov/elections/results_data/GG18/PrecinctResults.js). Gubernatorial results were extracted and processed using the state's [MetaData feed](https://elections.maryland.gov/elections/results_data/GG18/MetaData.js).

## Shapefiles
If you're looking for Maryland precinct shapefiles, you'll find them in the `shapefiles` folder under `md_all.zip`. The `ID` field corresponds to the `ID` column in the results file.

Shapefiles for most counties were obtained from the [Florida Election Science Team](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/NH5S2I) (also posted [on GitHub](https://github.com/nvkelso/election-geodata/tree/master/data/24-maryland)). For counties whose precinct boundaries have changed since 2016, the shapefiles were obtained directly from the counties. Shapefiles were combined using [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) and the `ID` field was generated to match the unique `ID` column in the results file.
